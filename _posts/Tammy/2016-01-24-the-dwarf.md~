body:  I ate an apple, and it protested,  little worm devoured my insides.  I ate an apple, two strong bites,  and it came through me twice.    Snow White had her little dwarfs to keep her,  preserve her under glass, a specimen  they fantasize about at night.    Sweeper, singer, baker of pies,  she kept the shortest men happy.  I string cramps, stings  along my spine.    I’m plugged into something I can’t control,  panels lit by organs&#58; heart’s glow,  deep sparkle of lung cavity,  steady pump of intestine.    Creatures creeping at night, reshaping me into being.
