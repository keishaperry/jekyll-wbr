body:  Knock Knock.    Whoâ€™s there?    Likes&#58; Spending time with friends (stomach and liver), the fetal position, and lead smocks used for dental x-rays. Dislikes&#58; sharp objects, radiation, and scooping the litterbox.    Advertisement for Self-Concious Uteruses&#58; birth-control pills and (anti) menopause pills look exactly alike! Aside&#58; They also look quite similar to Smints which is maybe why no one buys Smints anymore.
