  <p><em>[Show off your one-of-a-kind-style<br>
     </em>when I realized I was all alone I got bigger
    <br> <em>by embellishing a wide strip of fabric<br>
     </em>in secret and found and opened a quilted box filled
    <br> <em>with pearlescent discs or sparkling but ons<br>
     </em>with my mother’s straps and pins but when I think
    <br> <em>to create a belt that pops!<br>
     </em>of all the ways to tell everything at once
    <br> <em>Pair it with a dress, skirt, or whatever<br>
     </em>whatever is my favorite one ]
    <br> [ <em>TO USE: POUR UTILISER:</em>
    <br> Tap tap tap, rip, wrap, roll on.
    <br> <em>TO REMOVE: POUR ENLEVER:<br>
                                      </em>Pull out. Get off. Sigh deeply.
    <br> <em>TO DISPOSE: POUR JETER:<br>
                                      </em>Yank, tie off, toss, tell your diary.]
    <br> <em>                  [S’adapte à la plupart des petites culottes.</em>
    <br> when your hose are quitting
    <br> think <em>Un style qui scintille!</em>
    <br> just think of how your thighs kiss
    <br> think <em>Our thinnest and most flexible protection</em>.
    <br> and this discomforts you
    <br> <em>Daily Freshness.</em>
    <br> don’t think full load or fatality
    <br> <em>New look!</em>
    <br> and you won’t be laden by insides
    <br> <em>Shine on!</em>
    <br> coming all out]
    <br> [ <em>Shop the collection</em>
    <br> and whatever comes will be protected but lady
    <br> Preguntas?
    <br> isn’t Pregnant? though it looks it when you pray
    <br> <em>call 1-800-888-3115</em>
    <br> don’t forget to start with dying then always ask
    <br> <em>To open:</em>
    <br> to be more than you but you will trust
    <br> <em>lift here and</em>
    <br> yourself so little
    <br> <em>pull</em>
    <br> till you empty]</p>
