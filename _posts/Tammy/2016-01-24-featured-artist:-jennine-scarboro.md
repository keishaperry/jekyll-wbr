"beautiful"    Beautiful   Whisk me from my boring little island and deliver me to a world of glamour, high-fashion all-night champagne parties, and wealth.            "blonde"    Blonde   I would run from this room right now, find a tree, and string Barbie up.            "bothness"    Bothness   Find genius in the opposing position, privileging the complex messiness of the both over the simplistic clarity of the either/or.            "take    I Put This on for You Now Come and Take It Off   We are told nothing of the woman's appearance, she is revealed only through her ornaments.            "kant"    Kant   That landscape, that whole terror of the icy slope.            "marionette"    Marionette   She turns to me with malevolent red eyes. They glitter blankly and something is wrong with her hands. I realize, watching, that she is controlled by wires pulling her fingers along the keys.            "ontologicalq1"    Ontological Question 1   Death by gun shot, cancer, car crash, in your bed; it's all ultimately cardiopulmonary arrest&#58; The heart stops beating, oxygen can no longer reach the brain and that's it, you're dead. Always the same death.            "ontologicalq2"    Ontological Question 2   In a shadow we are equalized, all the same color, all with a mutable form that shifts with light, dense to translucent, stretched to compressed, thin to wide.            "witch"    Witch   The witch is an alluring vision who uses her loveliness to enchant, or she is an ugly and fearsome being who may transform into a nocturnal beast or disappear to lurk, invisible but watching.
