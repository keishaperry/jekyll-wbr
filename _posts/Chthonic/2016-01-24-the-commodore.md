_“But O heart! heart! heart!”_   
_—Walt Whitman_

On a dirigible made of bones  
gaining altitude in a stranger  
ocean & suddenly suddenly  
embracing atmosphere it takes  
our breath away we shout  

Commodore where is the escalator  
we shout Commodore we are refusing  
heaven shout Commodore where is the endless  
buffet where is the casino  

The Commodore asks for a show  
of hands  
The Commodore asks for coins  
for Charon & asks  

What does a soul  
sound like is it bouncing  
freely like an unexplained  
voice over the wailing loud  
speaker of a school fire drill  

The Commodore asks Who here  
is most qualified  
to drown & who to freeze  
who to pick apples We marvel at this  

all-you-can-eat table  
of crab legs & jello we marvel  
at the breadth of the whole  
fucking thing & we are  

so high up someone expresses concern  
that our skin will fall off  
someone mentions something  
about Icarus—but this is not  
like that  

Commodore our rent’s late again  
we’re letting her get away  
Commodore all we have left  
to mix with the vodka  
is mouthwash & Commodore  
we are too tired  
for the stairs let us sleep  
here Commodore let us  
sleep  

The Commodore asks us to pinpoint—  
Where is the life boat  
Where is the oxygen mask  
Where is the moment  
your life diverged so completely  
from itself that you became an empty  
impression  

The Commodore asks Have you ever  
lain on the ground & pretended  
you were a piece of lettuce The Commodore asks  
What will you remember  
The Commodore wide-eyed asks  
for two coins &  

The Commodore sighs slowly like blue  
like frantic pain his skin  
is stripped away The Commodore  
becomes the kind of naked  
we’ve only dreamed of The dance  
most of all The Commodore  
shouts into the feathered rest  
of everything & The Commodore goes up  
with his airship
