_[Show off your one-of-a-kind-style  
_when I realized I was all alone I got bigger  
_by embellishing a wide strip of fabric  
_in secret and found and opened a quilted box filled  
_with pearlescent discs or sparkling but ons  
_with my mother’s straps and pins but when I think  
_to create a belt that pops!  
_of all the ways to tell everything at once  
_Pair it with a dress, skirt, or whatever  
_whatever is my favorite one ]  
[_TO USE: POUR UTILISER:_  
Tap tap tap, rip, wrap, roll on.  
_TO REMOVE: POUR ENLEVER:  
_Pull out. Get off. Sigh deeply.  
_TO DISPOSE: POUR JETER:  
_Yank, tie off, toss, tell your diary.]  
_[S’adapte à la plupart des petites culottes._  
when your hose are quitting  
think _Un style qui scintille!_  
just think of how your thighs kiss  
think _Our thinnest and most flexible protection_.  
and this discomforts you  
_Daily Freshness._  
don’t think full load or fatality  
_New look!_  
and you won’t be laden by insides  
_Shine on!_  
coming all out]  
[_Shop the collection_  
and whatever comes will be protected but lady  
Preguntas?  
isn’t Pregnant? though it looks it when you pray  
_call 1-800-888-3115_  
don’t forget to start with dying then always ask  
_To open:_  
to be more than you but you will trust  
_lift here and_  
yourself so little  
_pull_  
till you empty]
